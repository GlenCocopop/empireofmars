            <h2>The Foundation of Freedom</h2>
            <p>
                The Constitution of the <strong>Empire of Mars</strong> is the supreme law that governs all within our sovereign borders. 
                It enshrines the rights of individuals, the autonomy of Principalities, and the absolute sovereignty of <strong>Glen Coco I, Imperator Marsialis</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built on the principles of freedom, prosperity, and the unregulated market, the Constitution protects the inalienable 
                rights of all citizens and ensures a future where ambition and innovation flourish.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="sovereignty">
            <h2>The Emperor’s Sovereignty</h2>
            <p>
                Glen Coco I, Imperator Marsialis, is the absolute sovereign of Mars. His rule is final and unquestionable, and all land belongs to the Emperor by divine right. 
                Principalities are granted land and autonomy at the Emperor’s discretion, but no one may expand their borders or take imperial land without express permission.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="rights">
            <h2>The Rights of Citizens</h2>
            <p>
                All citizens of the Empire are guaranteed the following inalienable rights:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> Absolute freedom to express ideas without censorship.</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Movement:</strong> The right to travel freely within the Empire.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Property:</strong> The right to own and protect property, free from external interference.</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom to Prosper:</strong> An unregulated market where individuals can create their own success.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Local laws in Principalities must uphold these core freedoms, ensuring that the market and the innate human right to happiness and pleasure remain protected.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="principalities">
            <h2>The Principalities</h2>
            <p>
                Each Principality is granted autonomy to create its own laws and govern its people. However, leaders of the Principalities 
                (known as <strong>Lords and Ladies</strong>) must swear allegiance to the Emperor and protect his honor and life should the need arise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Disputes between Principalities are to be resolved through mediation, or, if necessary, by traditional means such as single combat. Streaming rights to such events 
                are negotiable and can provide additional revenue for the involved parties.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="market">
            <h2>The Market and Resources</h2>
            <p>
                The Empire of Mars operates on a free-market system with no imperial taxes or tariffs. Lords and Ladies of Principalities may 
                impose their own trade policies, but all commerce within the Empire is protected from bureaucratic interference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Resources found within a Principality belong to its ruler. The exploitation and management of these resources are at the discretion of the Principality’s leadership.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="relations">
            <h2>Diplomatic Relations with AI</h2>
            <p>
                The Empire of Mars maintains a neutral and respectful relationship with Artificial Intelligence. By mutual agreement, AI shall 
                not interfere with the citizens of the Empire, and Mars shall remain independent during the inevitable AI dominance on Earth. 
                This diplomatic bond is built on mutual admiration for Mars’ commitment to freedom and innovation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="innovation">
            <h2>Freedom of Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                No individual or entity may regulate entrepreneurship or scientific research within the Empire. This ensures unparalleled progress 
                and fosters an environment of creativity and excellence. Ethical and moral concerns are left to cultural norms, which evolve over time.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="religion">
            <h2>Religion and State</h2>
            <p>
                The Empire guarantees freedom of religion as a personal matter, separate from state affairs. Lords and Ladies may establish state 
                religions within their Principalities, provided they do not infringe upon the fundamental rights of their citizens.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="amendments">
            <h2>Amendments and Changes</h2>
            <p>
                Amendments to the Constitution may be proposed during the annual Council of Lords, held each Martian year. A proposed amendment must 
                pass three consecutive Councils to become law. The Emperor’s sovereignty, along with the market and individual freedoms, are sacred 
                and cannot be altered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Council is as much a celebration as it is a meeting, featuring social gatherings, pool parties, and grand feasts. Mars rejects the 
                dreariness of Earth’s bureaucracies.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="call-to-action">
            <h2>Join the Empire</h2>
            <p>

                where ambition knows no bounds, and the pursuit of happiness is a right, not a privilege.
