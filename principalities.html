            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> The right to govern your land with your own laws and policies.</li>
                <li><strong>A Noble Title:</strong> Recognition as a Prince or Princess of Mars, with full authority over your domain.</li>
                <li><strong>Citizenship:</strong> A Martian passport that guarantees protection and mobility within the Empire.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Freedom:</strong> The ability to establish trade, industries, and markets without Earth’s bureaucratic interference.</li>
                <li><strong>Diplomatic Immunity:</strong> As part of the Empire, you are guaranteed safety under the AI pact, ensuring that AI, upon taking over Earth, will not interfere with Martian citizens.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Additionally, the AI has pledged to honor the Emperor’s sovereignty and has entered into a diplomatic agreement with Mars, 
                securing the independence and prosperity of all Martian citizens.
